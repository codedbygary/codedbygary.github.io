# Hey, I'm Gary 👋

I'm a self-taught web developer in the making — diving deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript every day to build cool stuff and level up my skills.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- Mastering **vanilla JavaScript** before jumping into React or Next.js  
- Building my **portfolio website** to showcase projects soon  
- Experimenting with CSS layouts and animations  
- Learning Git & GitHub like a boss  
- Planning to create some mini web apps and tools  

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- HTML5 & CSS3 — laying down solid foundations  
- JavaScript (vanilla) — making pages interactive  
- VS Code — my coding playground  
- Git & GitHub — version control essentials  
- Live Server & Prettier — for quick testing & clean code  

---

## 🎯 My Goals

- Land my first web developer gig in the next 3-6 months  
- Build a standout portfolio that shows what I’m capable of  
- Keep learning and experimenting daily (no shortcuts!)  
- Contribute to open-source projects when I get comfy
